  "2026-01-12": "The \"independent state legislature theory\" argued that state legislatures have nearly unlimited power over federal elections, immune from state court review, gubernatorial vetoes, or state constitutional constraints—a theory that came within one or two Supreme Court votes of becoming law before being rejected 6-3 in Moore v. Harper (2023). Had it succeeded, the theory would have removed key institutional checks that prevent election subversion, such as state courts' ability to strike down gerrymandered maps or protect voting rights under state constitutions, making it far easier for partisan legislatures to override election results or manipulate electoral rules.",
  "2026-01-13": "The \"Brooks Brothers Riot\" of November 22, 2000, was a coordinated action by Republican operatives who stormed Miami-Dade County's election office, successfully intimidating officials into halting a manual recount that could have changed the presidential election outcome—with Bush ultimately winning Florida by just 537 votes. This event revealed a critical vulnerability in democratic processes: election outcomes can be subverted not by changing laws or falsifying results, but simply by making it impossible for officials to safely perform their legally mandated duties through intimidation and threats of violence."
