    "summary": "The 2020 \"fake electors\" scheme involved 84 Republicans across seven swing states signing fraudulent certificates claiming to be legitimate electors, which was part of a coordinated three-part plan to create confusion about election results and exploit ambiguities when Congress counted electoral votes on January 6. The scheme failed because state officials like Georgia's Brad Raffensperger refused to provide official cover for the fake slates, but it revealed dangerous vulnerabilities in the election certification process that remain partially unresolved despite the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act.",

    "summary": "This newsletter argues that while individual Republican officials like Brad Raffensperger and Mike Pence saved democracy in 2020 by resisting pressure to overturn election results, relying on such individual courage is a dangerously fragile strategy with poor statistical odds of repeated success. The key takeaway is that democracy needs systemic protections—like automatic audits, transparent vote verification processes, and distributed power structures—that work regardless of whether officials in key positions act heroically, with the critical window for implementing these safeguards being now through late 2027 before the 2028 election.",
