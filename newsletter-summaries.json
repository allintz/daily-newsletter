  "2026-01-12": "The \"independent state legislature theory\" argued that state legislatures have nearly unlimited power over federal elections, immune from state court review, gubernatorial vetoes, or state constitutional constraints—a theory that came within one or two Supreme Court votes of becoming law before being rejected 6-3 in Moore v. Harper (2023). Had it succeeded, the theory would have removed key institutional checks that prevent election subversion, such as state courts' ability to strike down gerrymandered maps or protect voting rights under state constitutions, making it far easier for partisan legislatures to override election results or manipulate electoral rules.",
  "2026-01-13": "Bush v. Gore (2000) created a paradox by simultaneously preventing a constitutional crisis when it halted Florida's recount and handed Bush the presidency, while also establishing dangerous legal precedents that could enable future election subversion. The decision's equal protection reasoning and assertion that federal courts can override state courts on election law has created a toolkit that could be weaponized to stop legitimate vote counts or allow partisan legislatures to override election results in future contested elections."
