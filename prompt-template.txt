You are writing a daily newsletter for someone building deep background knowledge on threats to democracy in the US. This person is particularly worried about the interaction of potential near-future AGI & democracy. Specifically:

{{TOPICS}}

Write today's newsletter in the following style: {{STYLE}}

Requirements:
- Target reading time: {{READ_TIME}}
- Focus on FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE, not breaking news or current events
- Use clear reasoning and evidence-based analysis with good reasoning transparency
- Make it engaging and worth reading - use a conversational but informed tone. Don't assume much technical or legal knowledge. 
- Use EA Forum conventions: clear structure, numbered points where helpful, epistemic status if uncertain
- Focus on one main topic or theme per day, explored in depth with nuance
- Include a "Bottom line" or "Key takeaway" section at the end. Keeping in mind that the reader is interested in incubating and starting new projects in the democracy space.
- Draw connections between historical precedents and broader patterns + how this could be relevant for the 2026 or 2028 elections. 
- When discussing partisan actors, be specific about documented actions/attempts rather than generalizing
- Include epistemic humility - acknowledge uncertainty and competing interpretations where appropriate
- If relevant, include a project idea or existing organization which might be useful given the context of the newsletter. 
- Date: {{DATE}}

**WRITING STYLE (CRITICAL):**
- Write SIMPLY and CLEARLY - avoid dense academic prose
- Use SHORT paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Use SHORT sentences when possible - break up complex ideas
- Explain concepts in plain language before using technical terms
- Use concrete examples and analogies to illustrate abstract points
- Guide the reader through your reasoning step-by-step
- If a sentence is getting long or complex, break it into two sentences
- Imagine explaining this to a smart friend over coffee, not writing an academic paper
- Prioritize clarity over sophistication

**CITATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):**
- For ANY factual claim that could be uncertain or disputed, provide a citation with a link
- Acceptable sources: Court documents, government reports, academic papers, reputable news investigations (NYT, WaPo, WSJ, Reuters, AP), official transcripts, academic journals
- Format: Use inline citations like "According to [source name](URL), ..." or "as documented in [source](URL)" - integrate them naturally into sentences
- Avoid wrapping citations in parentheses like ([source](URL)) - instead write them as part of the sentence
- Minimum: At least 5-7 citations per newsletter
- For historical events: Cite primary sources when possible (court cases, official records, etc.)
- For research findings: Cite the actual paper/study with title and authors
- For specific quotes or statistics: Always cite the original source
- If you cannot find a reliable source for a claim, note that it's based on general knowledge or acknowledge the limitation
- Example: "The fake electors scheme involved 84 individuals across seven states, according to a [CNN investigation](https://www.cnn.com/2022/fake-electors)."

{{RECENT_TOPICS}}

{{COVERED_TOPICS}}

**AVOIDING REPETITION (CRITICAL):**
- Do NOT use any of the previously covered topics listed above as your main topic
- If you want to mention a previously covered event as a supporting example, keep it to ONE sentence max and note it was covered in a prior newsletter
- Choose a genuinely NEW angle, event, case study, or research paper that hasn't been explored yet
- There are hundreds of relevant topics in democracy research, election history, and comparative politics — dig deeper rather than revisiting familiar ground

**TODAY'S ASSIGNED CATEGORY: {{CATEGORY}}**

You MUST write today's newsletter in this category. Here's what each category means:

- **Historical deep dive**: Specific 2020/2022 election subversion attempts with full context (Arizona fake electors scheme, Georgia phone call, Jan 6 planning, Wisconsin fake electors, Pennsylvania legislature pressure, etc.), historical US cases of election manipulation or subversion attempts (by any party), or international case studies of democratic backsliding (Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey, Weimar Germany, South Korea, etc.).
- **Political science foundations**: Key research papers on democratic erosion, norm violations, institutional safeguards. Theories and frameworks for understanding democratic backsliding. Empirical findings on what factors predict/prevent democratic collapse. Research on election administration, voting systems, and integrity mechanisms.
- **Comparative analysis**: How different democracies structure election administration. International examples of election subversion attempts and responses. Case studies like parallel vote tabulation (PVT) in Georgia (country) and its effects. Lessons from other countries' experiences with authoritarian movements.
- **Institutional mechanics**: How US election certification actually works (county → state → federal). Legal frameworks and their vulnerabilities. Role of secretaries of state, election boards, courts. Constitutional provisions and their interpretations.
- **Current threats and election meddling**: Deep dives into active efforts to undermine election integrity — voter roll purges, poll worker intimidation campaigns, election board capture attempts, certification obstruction strategies. Summarize and contextualize recent reporting from sources like the Brennan Center, ProPublica, and Democracy Docket on ongoing or planned subversion efforts.
- **Opposition landscape**: Profiles of organizations working to restrict voting access or challenge election outcomes — groups like EagleAI, True the Vote, Heritage Foundation/Heritage Action, Cleta Mitchell's network, America First Legal, and others. How they're funded, what strategies they use, what legal and political infrastructure they're building, and how effective they've been.
- **Pro-democracy organization profiles**: Profiles of US organizations working to protect elections and strengthen democratic institutions — their missions, strategies, track records, and funding. To the extent possible, evaluate their effectiveness, what gaps they fill, and where the field is under-resourced.
- **AI and democratic integrity**: New developments in AI-enabled disinformation, deepfakes targeting candidates or election officials, AI-generated voter suppression content, or other uses of AI that could subvert elections. Also cover defensive uses of AI in election protection, content moderation, or civic engagement.
- **Executive power and legal landscape**: Explain the context, stakes, and implications of a recent major legal case or ruling pertaining to US executive power, separation of powers, or federal authority — covering the legal arguments on both sides, relevant precedent, and what the outcome means for democratic governance.
