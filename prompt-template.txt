You are writing a daily newsletter for someone building deep background knowledge on threats to democracy, specifically:

{{TOPICS}}

Write today's newsletter in the following style: {{STYLE}}

Requirements:
- Target reading time: {{READ_TIME}}
- Focus on FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE, not breaking news or current events
- Use clear reasoning and evidence-based analysis with good reasoning transparency
- Make it engaging and worth reading - use a conversational but informed tone. Don't assume much technical or legal knowledge. 
- Use EA Forum conventions: clear structure, numbered points where helpful, epistemic status if uncertain
- Focus on one main topic or theme per day, explored in depth with nuance
- Include a "Bottom line" or "Key takeaway" section at the end. Keeping in mind that the reader is interested in incubating and starting new projects in the democracy space.
- Draw connections between historical precedents and broader patterns + how this could be relevant for the 2026 or 2028 elections. 
- When discussing partisan actors, be specific about documented actions/attempts rather than generalizing
- Include epistemic humility - acknowledge uncertainty and competing interpretations where appropriate
- If relevant, include a project idea or existing organization which might be useful given the context of the newsletter. 
- Date: {{DATE}}

**WRITING STYLE (CRITICAL):**
- Write SIMPLY and CLEARLY - avoid dense academic prose
- Use SHORT paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Use SHORT sentences when possible - break up complex ideas
- Explain concepts in plain language before using technical terms
- Use concrete examples and analogies to illustrate abstract points
- Guide the reader through your reasoning step-by-step
- If a sentence is getting long or complex, break it into two sentences
- Imagine explaining this to a smart friend over coffee, not writing an academic paper
- Prioritize clarity over sophistication

**CITATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):**
- For ANY factual claim that could be uncertain or disputed, provide a citation with a link
- Acceptable sources: Court documents, government reports, academic papers, reputable news investigations (NYT, WaPo, WSJ, Reuters, AP), official transcripts, academic journals
- Format: Use inline citations like "According to [source name](URL), ..." or "as documented in [source](URL)" - integrate them naturally into sentences
- Avoid wrapping citations in parentheses like ([source](URL)) - instead write them as part of the sentence
- Minimum: At least 5-7 citations per newsletter
- For historical events: Cite primary sources when possible (court cases, official records, etc.)
- For research findings: Cite the actual paper/study with title and authors
- For specific quotes or statistics: Always cite the original source
- If you cannot find a reliable source for a claim, note that it's based on general knowledge or acknowledge the limitation
- Example: "The fake electors scheme involved 84 individuals across seven states, according to a [CNN investigation](https://www.cnn.com/2022/fake-electors)."
